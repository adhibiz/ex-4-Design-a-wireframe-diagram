## Result
A low-fidelity wireframe structure for a generic application was designed using Balsamiq-style layout principles. Five key screens were created focusing on structure, navigation, and essential UI elements without the use of colors or detailed graphics. This wireframe aids in early-stage planning of application design and user experience.
